**AI-powered chatbot that automatically converts your chat commitments into reminders.**

---

## Introduction

Ever found yourself in a rush, agreeing to *“send that file later”* or promising to *“call tomorrow”*, only for the commitment to be completely drowned out by the noise of everyday life?  

Just like the incessant beating of rain on a metal roof can derail a conversation, the sheer volume of daily digital communication causes our small, crucial promises to vanish into the chat history void.  

We lose our focus, and trust is silently eroded.  

**ReMindMe** is the tranquility we've been searching for.  

It’s a smart chatbot that doesn’t just listen to your conversations — it understands your intent.  
It works invisibly in the background, automatically creating reminders from your chat promises, ensuring you never miss a beat or break a simple word again.

## Pain Point / Problem Statement

People make hundreds of small, actionable commitments every day across multiple messaging platforms.  

These small promises are the building blocks of relationships and productivity — yet they are the most challenging to track.  

Traditional reminder apps demand **manual effort**:  
you have to stop your conversation, open another app, type out the commitment, and set the time.  

It’s tedious, distracting, and easily skipped in the flow of a fast-moving chat.
